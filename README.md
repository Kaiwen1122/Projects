Project 1 : Using logistic Regression Model to Predict Heart Disease Staglog(STAT 3675)

    1. Conducted in-depth analysis of a heart disease dataset, encompassing 270 samples and 14 variables. Utilized logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease, considering factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.
    2. Presented a clear overview of the dataset's origin, size, and key variables. Employed visual aids such as histograms, bar plots, pie charts, and box plots to illustrate data distributions effectively.
    3. Applied hypothesis testing to establish the association between predictors and the binary target variable.Rigorously assessed multicollinearity, ensuring the reliability of the logistic regression model. Formulated a robust logistic regression model, systematically reducing it based on AIC's values through step-wise selection and the prediction accuaracy increased 2\%.
    4.  Addressed assumptions of logistic regression, confirming the model's appropriateness. Acknowledged limitations, including missing variables such as smoking habits and dietary factors. Recognized the trade-off between model complexity and prediction accuracy, proposing potential areas for improvement.
