## Project 1 : Using logistic Regression Model to Predict Heart Disease Staglog(STAT 3675 at UConn)

We analyzed a heart disease dataset with 270 samples and 14 variables using logistic regression to predict heart disease likelihood based on factors like age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. We gave a clear overview of the dataset's origin, size, and key variables, using visual aids such as histograms, bar plots, pie charts, and box plots to illustrate data distributions. We applied hypothesis testing to determine associations between predictors and the target variable, and rigorously assessed multicollinearity to ensure the model's reliability. We developed a robust logistic regression model, refining it through stepwise selection based on AIC values, which increased prediction accuracy by 2%. We addressed logistic regression assumptions to confirm the model's suitability, acknowledged limitations such as missing variables like smoking habits and dietary factors, and recognized the trade-off between model complexity and prediction accuracy while suggesting areas for improvement.

## Project 2: How to get into Graduate School Successfully?(STAT 3494W at UConn )
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing graduate school admissions using data from Kaggle, applied logistic regression to identify key factors, addressed multicollinearity between TOEFL and GRE scores using VIF, compared logistic and linear regression models, and identified methodological limitations while proposing suggestions for future research.


## Project 3: A Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model from statistical physics(Scientific Computing With Python at University of Chicago) 

I collaborated with team members Hantao Xiao and Alexander Cram to conduct a Monte Carlo simulation of the 2-D Ising model, contributed by writing key functions such as cal_Energy, energy_change, and MCMC_step, integrated these into the simulation model to generate comprehensive outputs, used Metropolis-Hastings and Wolff clustering algorithms for the Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation, explored efficiency trade-offs between these algorithms, and analyzed the relationship between magnetization and critical temperature across different temperatures and lattice sizes.

## Project 4: Connection between Graph Neural Networks and ODEs (Machine learning on Graph, Group and Manifold at University of Chicago)
